<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Rafael Gerotto Coelho</h1>
<p align=left">Hello! I am a graduate graphic designer with a recent passion for web development. As an immigrant, I am proud to have settled in Spain 4 years ago after having lived 6 years in England, which makes me confident in speaking English and Spanish, in addition to Portuguese, which is my native language. My professional career has been varied, starting with jobs in which I was in direct contact with the public.</p>
<p>In the last 3 years, I have had the opportunity to work for a large company that controls the most popular social networks in the world. During my time at this company, in my daily routine I collaborate with users from various cultures and communities. My role has been focused on managing and moderating content created by users.</p>
<p>My experience as a graphic designer has given me unique abilities to understand visual aesthetics and combine it with my new skills as a web developer. I'm happy to bring my creativity and technical knowledge to web projects, where I can combine technical functionality with a visually appealing approach.</p>
<p>Currently, my goal is to continue growing and improving as a web developer, exploring new technologies and expanding my knowledge in web design. I am open to opportunities that allow me to collaborate on challenging and creative projects, where I can use my skills in graphic design and web development to create impactful digital experiences.</p> 
<p>If you are looking for a versatile professional who is excited to explore new opportunities and contribute to the success of your project, don’t hesitate to reach me out!</p>
